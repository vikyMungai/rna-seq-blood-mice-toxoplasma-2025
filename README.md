# rna-seq-blood-mice-toxoplasma-2025
## Owner 

## Description 
Bulk RNA-sequencing and differential expression analysis of blood samples from mice. The mice are divided in two groups: one is infected with toxoplasma and the other is uninfected control groups. 

### Structure of the workflow 
Starting from the fastq files of the samples the workflow is divided in 6 main steps: 
1. Quality checks
2. Map reads to the reference genome
3. Count the number of reads per gene
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. Differential expression analysis
6. Overrepresentation analysis
